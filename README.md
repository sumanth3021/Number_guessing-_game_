# 🤖 Number Guessing Game — Computer Guesses the User's Number

A fun Python console game where the computer tries to guess the number you are thinking of, using logic and binary search! 🎯

---

## 📌 Project Description

In this game, **you (the user)** think of a number between 1 and 100, and the **computer** will guess it based on your feedback:

- `'h'` → too high  
- `'l'` → too low  
- `'c'` → correct  

The game continues until the computer correctly guesses the number.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Think of a number between 1 and 100 (keep it secret).
3. When the computer makes a guess:
   - Type `'h'` if the guess is too high  
   - Type `'l'` if the guess is too low  
   - Type `'c'` if the guess is correct  
4. The computer will adjust its guess accordingly and try again!
